      <p class="mb-6">
        Before you start looking for a home to buy, it’s a good idea to meet with your Loan Officer to get pre-approved for a loan amount.
        At this stage, the lender gathers information about income, assets, and debts of the borrower (you) to determine how much house you may be able to afford.
        This includes a credit report, W-2 forms, pay stubs, Federal Tax Returns and recent bank statements. Knowing your budget before you start looking for a home
        will help you narrow down your search and avoid wasting time on homes that are out of your price range.

      <p>
        If you haven’t experienced it before, the home loan process can feel overwhelming, but our agents will help you stay informed throughout the process, from pre-approval to closing.
        The first thing to do is consult with a mortgage specialist (or two). If you don’t already have someone in mind, we partner with some of the best lenders in the industry,
        and we’d be happy to introduce you, so you’ll be taken care of.
